# VIP-Contribution

## Spring and Summer
- facilitate the design of the ScoreFollower module
- Participate in the spring research expo at Purdue (``poster presentation 4_4_2024.pdf'')
- Proposed a trivial solution with implementation, but the solution was shown too naive for Companion (in folder ``get_notes_and_start_end_times``)
- find python implementation of the online DTW algorithm (the main algorithm used in ScoreFollower) in https://github.com/matthewcaren/web-score-following
## Fall Semester
- Write tests for existing module and benchmark their performance (``tests_written_or_debugged/``)
- Debug written tests and fix them with proper mocking strategies
- write utilities scripts that facilitate developers to test their code (``testing_util_scripts/``)
- Set up a CI pipeline consisting of automatic testing and linting on both old and new python modules (``CI/`` folder)
